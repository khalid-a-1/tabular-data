# CS 181: Data Systems

## Unit 01 Tabular: Unit Project

### Weather Data and Flights Data

All projects in this course share some basic learning objectives:

1. Use real data collected and compiled together by some outside entity.
2. Use tools and techniques of the Unit to help acquire and transform the data into a useable form.
3. Corollary to 2, synthesize many individual skills into a coherent whole to solve a problem.
4. Incorporate coherent documentation to describe the start-to-finish process of the project, including describing questions of the project and answers developed.
5. Build a visualization to help understand the data acquired.

Your submission files should include a single .ipynb file and additional pictures or pdfs to support your code, 
documentation, and essay explaining the process of completing your project.

See the attached python notebook for additional details.
